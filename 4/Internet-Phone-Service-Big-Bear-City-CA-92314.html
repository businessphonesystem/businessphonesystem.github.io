<p>VoIP phone service has been around for a long time as business owners and organisations change from telephone services that use PSTN (Public Changed Telephone Network) to a more advanced system. PBX stands for personal branch exchange, which is a fancy term for a business phone system. Business VoIP phone service has been advancing over the previous years. Other than the delivery technique, there are no distinctions between a VoIP calls and a standard telephone call. You can also position or get call through multiple devices (desk phone, computer system, mobile phone, tablet, etc.) with VoIP, and overall, the sound quality is just much better (with the correct internet setup and bandwidth accessibility, that is).</p>
<p>In addition, VoIP providers make it easy to include new users. Maybe the most important distinction is that the area code has no real importance to VoIP phone systems.

VoIP is particularly matched for those employees who are not tethered to a desk or conventional office setup.</p>
