<p>VoIP phone service has been around for some time as organisations and entrepreneurs change from telephone services that use PSTN (Public Changed Telephone Network) to a more advanced system. There is a huge variety of VoIP providers on the internet which offer SIP trunking (telephony services) for cheaper call rates than traditional telephony providers.
